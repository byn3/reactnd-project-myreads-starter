# TL;DR

To get started:
* clone this repo, cd into the directory  
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

There may be a bug where you may also need to use `npm install react-router-dom`

The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that is used to persist information as you interact with the application.

# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this project is to be able to search for books using a BooksAPI and put them on virtual "shelves." There are 3 shelves a user may put a book. The first is a 'currently reading' shelf, the next is 'want to read', and the last is 'have read.'

The user can click or tap on the green circles that is located on the covers or thumbnails of each book to add the books to a list.
